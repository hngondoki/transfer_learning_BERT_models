Abstract
2 Transfer learning has emerged as a
3 cornerstone of modern natural language
4 processing (NLP), particularly with
5 transformer-based architectures like BERT
6 and its variants. Despite substantial
7 progress, critical questions remain
8 regarding how best to transfer knowledge
9 across domains, the influence of training
10 data sequences, and the effectiveness of
11 different BERT models in transfer
12 scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the
13 transferability and generalization capability
14 of RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa
15 across related and unrelated domains using
16 the Amazon Reviews dataset. We design
17 three pipelines to analyze domain
18 similarity, sequencing, dataset sizes, and
19 fine-tuning strategies. Our results
20 demonstrate the importance of sequencing,
21 domain similarity, and hyperparameter
22 tuning in optimizing cross-domain
23 performance. DeBERTa shows superior
24 cross-domain transfer, while RoBERTa
25 excels in low-resource fine-tuning. These
26 findings provide practical insights for
27 leveraging transfer learning in real-world
28 NLP applications.
